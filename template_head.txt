# Description:  This is a python script that generates design iterations for
#               a Jinja2 tagged C/C++ design
#
# **NOTE**: This script is subject to change a lot depending on discussions
#           with Dr. Arora and Dr. Zhigang. Right not I have just used it
#           to generate some hand written design iterations automatically
#           Only includes a set of directives for atax.* benchmark
